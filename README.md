# bash-scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have made. Will continually update this as I make more of them.
## ldap-add
A script that eases the process of adding entries to OpenLDAP. See the help message within the script for more details.
## pom-parser
A script that is supposed to take the dependencies from a pom.xml file and then print them to standard out such that one can use the output as
the classpath when running a Java virtual machine. Unfortunately I havent gotten around to finishing it yet, but I hope to come back to it
one day.
